//! Transaction processing glue code, mainly consisting of Object-safe traits
//!
//! [InstalledSchedulerPool] lends one of pooled [InstalledScheduler]s as wrapped in
//! [BankWithScheduler], which can be used by `ReplayStage` and `BankingStage` for transaction
//! execution. After use, the scheduler will be returned to the pool.
//!
//! [InstalledScheduler] can be fed with [SanitizedTransaction]s. Then, it schedules those
//! executions and commits those results into the associated _bank_.
//!
//! It's generally assumed that each [InstalledScheduler] is backed by multiple threads for
//! parallel transaction processing and there are multiple independent schedulers inside a single
//! instance of [InstalledSchedulerPool].
//!
//! Dynamic dispatch was inevitable due to the desire to piggyback on
//! [BankForks](crate::bank_forks::BankForks)'s pruning for scheduler lifecycle management as the
//! common place both for `ReplayStage` and `BankingStage` and the resultant need of invoking
//! actual implementations provided by the dependent crate (`solana-unified-scheduler-pool`, which
//! in turn depends on `solana-ledger`, which in turn depends on `solana-runtime`), avoiding a
//! cyclic dependency.
//!
//! See [InstalledScheduler] for visualized interaction.
